lmc.pl

The code is logically divided into two portions:
1. "lmc_load". Given an input file, generates initial memory
2."execution_loop", takes in input the generated memory and executes
instructions contained within.


-'acceptFile' (called in lmc_load) accepts input file as valid and saves labels, istructions and arguments.
	This appens through the simulation of a PDA with 3 stacks (labels, istructions, arguments)
	defined as follows:
	-Q = {new_line, found_label, found_ist_arg, found_ist_no_arg, found_dat, found_arg}
	-sigma (input alphabet), set of all valid labels and assembly instructions
	-gamma (stack alphabet), same as sigma
	-delta, defined in the program
	-q0 = new_line
	-Z0 = [] (empty list), the "initial symbol" of each stack
	-F = {new_line}
	For convenience, acceptFile creates Mem lsit that, in the last computational step, saves
	the elements of the three stacks;
-Elements in 'arguments' are substituted by the index at which
	they appear in 'labels';
-Elements in 'instructions' are substituted by the corresponding
	machine code;
-The Little Man Computer memory is generated by summing elements at the same index
	in 'instructions' and 'arguments'.

'execution_loop' simulates a Finite State Automata as it follows:
-Q = all the possible lmc states;
-sigma = {0, 1, ..., 999};
-delta, defined as in 'one_instruction' (see code);
-q0 = state(0, 0, Mem, In, [], noflag)
-F, set of halted_state

Those 2 portions are called in 'lmc_run'.
